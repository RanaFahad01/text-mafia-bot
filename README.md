# The Text-Based Mafia Bot

## Getting started with development
- Set up a bot through the discord developer portal and get a token. Refer to [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/KZ3tIGHU314?si=6hSMe6iZLwZkR_-3) if you need pointers on how to do so.
- Clone this repository.
- Run "npm install" to install the dependencies.
- Create a file named ".env" inside the src/ directory.
- Inside the .env file, copy-paste the bot token into the "TOKEN" property like so:
  - `TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`
- Run "npm index.js" in the root directory of the project to run the bot.
